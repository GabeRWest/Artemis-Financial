# Artemis-Financial
Artemis Financial for CS 305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
My client was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that handles sensitive customer information and needed to strengthen its software security.
They wanted me to identify weaknesses in their existing code and recommend secure encryption algorithms to protect data during transmission and storage.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I did well identifying outdated or vulnerable dependencies and explaining how to mitigate them. I also used industry best practices like validating certificates, updating libraries, and applying AES encryption for secure communication.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part was interpreting the dependency-check results and deciding which vulnerabilities posed the biggest risks

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by using SSL/TLS for data in transit, implementing strong hashing (SHA-256) for verification, and enforcing secure coding patterns throughout the codebase

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By using automated tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and follow frameworks such as OWASP Top Ten and Oracle Secure Coding Guidelines to assess vulnerabilities and choose mitigation strategies

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used tools like Maven Dependency-Check, the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names resource, and Oracle’s Secure Coding Guidelines

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers my ability to implement encryption algorithms and run automated dependency checks.
